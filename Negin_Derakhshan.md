Hi, My name is Negin Derakhshan
My favourite sport to do is running, note the kind that you do to reach the end the first or fastest, the one you can do it where ever you want to clear your head. I love it because I think it's pue, no rules no tools needed.
There is no 1 favourite food, I am a foodie. But one of the most favourite one if I have to choose would be pasta Carbonara. I jist love every part of it specially if I have mushroom on it as well. it would be the combination of everything I love, Pasta, bacon, cream and cheese.
Here is one of my favourite tracks:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zpWBA9hc4k
Well, It is not necessarily interesting, but it is something I am very proud of, I have quite smoking in last two month after several years of being a smoker and I feel great about it.
